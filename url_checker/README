This script gets on input list of urls - creates requests and send them to predefined server.
Next, return code + IP_address of the server are logged to either log file or xls report.

All settings can be done via config_file.py

>> Scenario

Assume that all of your webpages are hosted on 4 different server (S1,S2,S3,S4).
Your task is to ensure, that after each deploy to production, all main pages (and servers)
are up and running.
You've been given a complete list of the URLs that should be validated on each server.
-> config_file.py >> URLS.input

There are four host files with appropriate list of IP addresses (and corresponding host names)
-> host_S1, host_S2, host_S3, host_S4
These files are iteratively switched with the original host file "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" 
(in my case, it ensures that requests actually hit proper server - bypassing proxy server)
