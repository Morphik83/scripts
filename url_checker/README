Script gets on the input, list of urls then creates requests and send them to predefined server.
Next, return code + IP_address of the actual host are logged to either log file or xls report.

Settings can be done via config_file.py

>> Scenario

Assume that all of your webpages are hosted on a couple of different servers (eg.S1,S2,S3,S4).
Your task is to ensure, that after each deploy, all the most important pages (and servers)
are up and running (you do not have direct access to the backend)
You've been given a complete list of the URLs that should be validated on each server.
-> config_file.py >> URLS.input

So, lets say that there are four host files with appropriate list of IP addresses (and corresponding host names)
-> Server_hosts_1, Server_hosts_2, Server_hosts_3, Server_hosts_4
These files are iteratively switched with the original host file "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" 
(in my case, it ensures that requests actually hit proper server - bypassing proxy server)
and all the URLS are verified on every server.

Report file if saved with information about return code and eventual errors (see 'example_Input_Report' dir)

'xlwt' module > to generate XLS report 
'mechanize' module > to handle sending requests/getting responses (it forks urllib2 library)
'pacparser' module > to parse PAC Proxy file 

To run:
1.copy url_checker.py + config_file.py to any location on your system (LOCATION)
2.for safety reasons make a copy of the original 'hosts' file by yourself (eg. hosts_COPY)
3.edit config_file.py
  |->ensure, that in PATH_HOSTS (C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\drivers\\etc) there are proper server_host files
     example content of the PATH_HOST dir:
	  hosts
	  SEGOTN2543
	  SEGOTN2525
	  SEGOTN2523
	  hosts_COPY
  |->enter PATH (location where reports will be saved and URLS.input must be placed!) 
  |->create URLS.input file and place it in the PATH (example attached)
  |->decide what type or Report should be created (.xls or .log) by setting the REPORT_NAME
  |->if Xnet pages will be checked, then provide valid login/pass, otherwise not needed (for Inet pages)
4.run script from CLI (python url_checker.py)
 
How script is actually running?
FOR EACH SERVER_FILE:
	'hosts' file -> renamed to 'hosts_backUp'
	SEGOTNXX -> renamed to 'hosts'
	urls from URLS.input are checked and results are saved to the report file
	'hosts_BackUp' -> renamed to 'hosts'
