This script gets on input list of urls - creates requests and send them to predefined server.
Next, return code + IP_address of the server are logged to either log file or xls report.

All settings can be done via config_file.py

>> Scenario

Assume that all of your webpages are hosted on 4 different server (S1,S2,S3,S4).
Your task is to ensure, that after each deploy to production, all main pages (and servers)
are up and running.
You've been given a complete list of the URLs that should be validated on each server.
-> config_file.py >> URLS.input

There are four host files with appropriate list of IP addresses (and corresponding host names)
-> Server_hosts_1, Server_hosts_2, Server_hosts_3, Server_hosts_4
These files are iteratively switched with the original host file "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" 
(in my case, it ensures that requests actually hit proper server - bypassing proxy server)
and all the URLS are verified on every server.

Report file if saved with information about return code and eventual errors (see 'example_Input_Report' dir)

'xlwt' module > to generate XLS report 
'urllib2' module > to handle sending requests/getting responses 

To run:
1.Copy Server_hosts_X (hosts files) to "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts"
2.In config_file.py define:
-PATH (where URLS.input is stored and where reports should be saved)
-request header
-FILE_WITH_URLS (name of the report file + valid extension -> LOG/XLS)
-PATH_HOSTS (location of your original 'hosts' file; usually "'C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\drivers\\etc")
-server_hosts_pattern (regex to catch all the server files, eg. re.compile(r'^SEGOTN\d{4}$'))
3.Run url_checker.py and observe in console results.
